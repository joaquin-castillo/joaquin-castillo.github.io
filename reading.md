**Skunk Works** by Ben Rich & Leo Janos  
&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;&#11088;  
I wouldn't consider myself an aviation enthusiast, but it's hard to not to fall in love with engineering masterpieces like the Lockheed U-2, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 Nighthawk. The book consists of a collection of memoirs from Ben Rich, second director of Lockheed's Advanced Development Program, Skunkworks, succeeding the infamous Kelly Johnson. The book begins with Rich's days as engineer working under Johnson and eventually progresses to his position as director. When I first picked this book up, I could not put it down for a few days. The stories behind the design of super-sonic, high-altitude, radar-invisible aircraft are fascinating, as these are no simple feats. My biggest takeaway from this book was inspiration for true problem solving. I rate this a 4/5 just because some of the memoirs can get a little verbose and repetitive, but overall I would highly recommend this read to anyone remotely interested in aviation, engineering, or overcoming the impossible.
