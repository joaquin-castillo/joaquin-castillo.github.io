### **Graduate**
___
**ME 218 D-bugger** | Stanford University  
ME218D project. Our team of seven students designed and produced a debugger to be used in future ME218 labs. The debugger is composed of a physical intermediary device, a GUI, and modifications to the course Events and Services Framework. The debugger allows students to visualize state changes, priorities, ISRs, code breakpoint "spot checkers", and allows students to inject events into their systems in real time. I owned the hardware design and bring-up for the intermediary board.

**Wifi Module** | Stanford University  
For my EE256 Board Level Design final project, my partner Kevin and I designed and a wifi module board based off of the [Adafruit Airlift](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201?gclid=Cj0KCQiA_bieBhDSARIsADU4zLcJ4AEthAIa5Rh03G1QG2o_ekHk3Evyth7sVIhtiNrcc8yb8vrOtn8aAh5QEALw_wcB), featuring the [ESP32-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32_datasheet_en.pdf) module. Our design eliminated the need for the ESP32 module and included it's own copper trace antenna. The board communicated with our microcontroller via a SPI interface.

**Bicycle Speed and Cadence Sensor** | Stanford University  
For a lab assignment in ME218D, I designed a PCBA prototype for a bike speed and cadence sensor. The sensor works using a linear hall effect sensor to trigger a comparator on the onboard microcontroller. When the magnet, attached to either a crank or wheel spoke, passes by the hall sensor, the voltage output increases above the comparator's threshold, triggering an interrupt to capture the current time to calculate speed/cadence. The board is powered by a single coin cell battery and communicates via UART. Eventually, I'd like to integrate Bluetooth capabilities to transmit data to a screen mounted to the bike's handlebars. This would be a great low-cost gadget to pass out at triathlon trainer practices, where we can all monitor our pedaling cadences.

**Remote Controlled Watercraft** | Stanford University  
ME218C project. In just four weeks my team and I designed and built a water craft and remote control. The two communicate wirelessly over XBee through our class-wide protocol.

**Autonomous Basketball Robot** | Stanford University  
ME218B project consisting of an autonomous robot that drives into a scoring zone, actively locates an IR beacon, and shoots three pre-loaded balls into a goal.

**Interactive Arcade Game** | Stanford University  
ME218A project consisting of a robotic arm controlled by joystick that grabs a toy boat via electromagnet, and moves it from dock to water (or vice versa).
