Below is a listing of projects I've worked on, either on a team or on my own, that are not protected by NDA. Since middle school, I've tried to keep myself busy with at least one project where I'm learning something new. In recent years, college projects have tended to dominate most of my time, but I still enjoy working on my bikes or this website in my spare time.

### **Graduate**
___
**ME 218 D-bugger** | Stanford University  
ME 218D project. Our team of seven students designed and produced a debugger to be used in future ME218 labs. The debugger is composed of a physical intermediary device, a GUI, and modifications to the course Events and Services Framework. The debugger allows students to visualize state changes, priorities, ISRs, code breakpoint "spot checkers", and allows students to inject events into their systems in real time. I owned the hardware design and bring-up for the intermediary board.

**Remote Controlled Watercraft** | Stanford University
