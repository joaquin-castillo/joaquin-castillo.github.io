Hi, I'm Joaquin - Engineer, Designer, Cycling Enthusiast.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
I'm currently pursuing a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford University with a focus in mechatronic design. I completed my bachelor's in mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I worked with and lead a team of students in designing and building a remote sensing weather satellite. I’m interested in applying my skills and education to helping solve the world’s biggest human and environmental problems.
