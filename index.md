Hi, I'm Joaquin.
</p> -->
<p style="text-align: justify">
I'm pursuing a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford with a focus in Mechatronics, the intersection of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. I completed my bachelor's in ME at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I worked with a team of students to build a remote-sensing weather satellite. I’m interested in applying my skills to helping solve the world’s biggest human and environmental problems.

In my free time I'm training with the Stanford University Triathlon Team, cycling around the Bay Area, hanging out at the bouldering gym, or skiing in winter months. In general, I love staying mentally and physically active.
