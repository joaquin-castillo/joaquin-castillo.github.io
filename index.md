[comment]: Here's where my bio is going (for now)
<p style="text-align: justify">
Hi, I'm Joaquin - eningeer, designer, cycling enthusiast.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford University with a focus in mechatronics and design. I completed my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I had to opportunity to work with and lead a team of students in designing and building a remote sensing weather CubeSat, which launched in 2020. During the pandemic, I took a year off to work in aerospace and learn from industry professionals and practices. I’m interested in applying my education to helping solve the world’s human and environmental problems. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, mountain biking, skiing, climbing, and any excuse to get outside.
